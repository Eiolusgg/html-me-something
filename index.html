<article><h2>Story:</h2></article>
<p1>About ten years ago I was lucky enough to be taken on the fishing trip of a lifetime
    by my Grandfather. The destination of choice? Wine Lake, located in the wilderness
    of Northwestern Ontario, Canada. After a very long two-day drive, and a seemingly endless stay at the border we arrived!
    To get to the camp, not only did we have to drive for two days - we also had to load all of our gear into a boat and ride
    for 45 minutes and unload the gear. Only to drag our boats across an impassable rocky outcrop and reload them
    - followed by another healthy boat-ride.</p1>

<br>
<p1>The Canadian Wilderness is rife with all sorts of wildlife. From Smallmouth Bass, Pike and Walleye to Moose,
    Grizzly Bears and even Timberwolves! In true spirit of the essence of angling, there was also a heavily enforced catch & release policy.</p1>

<p1>True outdoorsmen can survive without running water and electricity.(I am not one,
    though it was rather invigorating to experience for two weeks.) However I highly prefer the use of a conventional toilet over an outhouse.</p1>
